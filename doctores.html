                        <h3>Mr.Shubham Madke</h3>
                        <p>During Recent COVID pandemic we saw many people are deprived from the information about COVID situation. So we Sahayog Samarpan Group thought that we should arrange a social media platforms where all will get verified info about availability of beds , plasma , blood & injection.
                           I am Mr Shubham Madke , When our What's up group was form we found a lot of requirements from our members it was difficult to verify all the things. Then we made smart management for verification about data that only we were sharing & Through this our system became flexible. Within 2 days our 2 What's up group were full. It was our responsibility to fullfill all requirements. Sometimes we have received call at midnight. With personal msg also people were calling us because they believe in our verified information. As till yet we successfully help to 100-120 patients with confirmation. We reached our help in different parts of Maharashtra also we provide info in Delhi, UP, Gujarat & Telangana.üôè
                           
                          As this is a tough time for all of us , we believe that we will fight with unity by providing helping hands to each other . So our team appeals all of u to wear mask ,do sanitization & Take care of yourself </p>

                        <h3>Mr.Rushikesh Ghule</h3>
                        <p>Hi, My Name is Rushikesh Ghule and I'm volunteer of Sahyog Samarpan Group, Our group aims for working towards welfare and happiness of society, elders,etc.
                           We have started "We Can" campaign to fight against Covid by getting help of beds, ventilator, blood to people across Maharashtra. And we had also made a family of 600+ whatsapp participants.
                           I'm very happy to work in this Covid situation and help as many people as we can . It is very interesting and painful to work in this situation as Everyday we come across many patients, who don't get needed medical treatment on time due to lack of medical equipments or hospital.
                           I personally experienced few things in this situation- Life is very beautiful,so to experience it more you have to remain strong to fight the disease. There is lot of Pain in Society, if we go out and see the sufferings our heart gets filled with sorrow. You have to know people's pain to help them. While working I also experienced that We are very lucky to have secured healthy living.
                           I truly understood the meaning of humanity, Life, Care, Sorrow, Truth, Sufferings, mishaps and Fortune while working in this situation.I have also experienced that Will power can Turn out the things, the way you want. Our will to do something for society is courageous part of our heart.
                           I'm Happy to say that our Team work has helped us over come problems and get help to many more people.
                           Finally, I would say that I'm happy to do something for society, may it be little as "Drop drop makes a Ocean",our little help may change little situation,So let us hope good for all 
                        ThankYou...</p>
